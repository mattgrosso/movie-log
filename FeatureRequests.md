We should look into running multiple database instances (they call it sharding) https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/sharding

Can I rework the design so there's only one screen where you search and see your db?

Why is clicking on settings logging me out every time?

I'd like some sort of view that shows my watches over time (like a calendar maybe)
