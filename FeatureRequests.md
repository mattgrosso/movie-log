We should look into running multiple database instances (they call it sharding) https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/sharding

Maybe we should scroll to top after each navigation?

Better view for shared results. With images.

Can I rework the design so there's only one screen where you search and see your db?

Genres should be clickable just like keywords
