## Favorite Sections — Live Tuning (Jun 2026)

The 8 `Favorite*` sections on the Insights page (Directors, Writers, Composers, Cinematographers, Editors, Producers, Actors, Actresses) each rank people by a weighted Bayesian score. Each now has an inline **✏️ tuner**: a small icon-only button pinned to the right of the section's top-border title (absolutely positioned against `.insights-pane`, so the centered title is undisturbed) that opens a collapsing accordion of labeled sliders with plain-language help text.

- **Shared machinery: `src/mixins/favoriteTuning.js`.** Holds ONLY the type-agnostic plumbing: the TMDB details cache (`detailsCache`), Firebase load/save of tuner values (`loadPersistedTuning`/`persistTuning`), tuner event handlers (`onTunerUpdate`/`resetTuner` → `await this.rescore()`), `getCachedDetails`, `bayesianAverage` (with a `globalAvgOverride` param), `mostRecentRating`, `getDetailsForCastMember`, `updateSearchValue`, and the `mounted`→`waitForDataAndBuildList` boot. Exposes `getRating`. A consumer MUST provide: data `tuningKey` + `tuningDefaults` + one data prop per lever; computed `tunerLevers`; methods `averageRating`, `buildTopTwelveList` (gather), `rescore`.
- **Per-section independence preserved.** Every section keeps its own `tuningDefaults`, lever values, gather logic, blend field, and scoring quirks in its own file. Values persist per section at `settings/favoriteTuning/<key>` (keys: `director`/`writer`/`composer`/`cinematographer`/`editor`/`producer`/`actor`/`actress`) and survive refresh + sync across devices. The mixin holds zero tuning values.
- **Gather/rescore split = no re-fetch while tuning.** `buildTopTwelveList` gathers people ONCE per data load (no TMDB, no minEntries filter); `rescore` scores eligible people with current levers, lazily fetching+caching TMDB details only for the eligible set, guarded by a `rescoreSeq` token that drops superseded async passes. Dragging a slider never re-hits TMDB (enforced by test).
- **Lever sets differ by archetype** (each `tunerLevers` reflects only what that section actually uses):
  - Crew **with blend** (Directors=`direction`, Writers=`story`, Composers=`soundtrack`, Cinematographers=`imagery`): minEntries, confidenceNumber, countWeight, knownForWeight, `<blend>Weight`.
  - Crew **no blend** (Editors, Producers): the same minus the blend lever (Producers' `countWeight` slider maxes at 10 — its default is 5).
  - **Cast** (Actors gender 2, Actresses gender 1): minEntries, confidenceNumber, billingLimit, billingExponent, performanceWeight. Cast `rescore` RE-GATHERS each pass (billingLimit/billingExponent change the gathered set/weights) and walks highest-bayesian-first, gender-gating via cached TMDB lookups until 12 found.
- **Exact scoring preserved per section.** Known-for bonus intentionally differs: Directors/Composers blend the role sub-score; Writers/Cinematographers/Editors/Producers use the plain overall (`calculatedTotal`). `manualBoosts` is a dormant empty scaffold — NOT exposed in the tuner (cast components never had it).
- **Net effect**: added the whole tuning feature while the 8 components shrank ~300 lines (dedup of the cloned machinery). Dead `compareTwoLists`/`isList…`/`get*Breakdown` helpers were dropped.
- **UI component: `FavoriteTuner.vue`** (presentational only — emits `update`/`reset`). Tests: `FavoriteTuning.test.js` (Directors deep-dive), `FavoriteSectionsTuning.test.js` (all 8: build, persist key, live retune, no-refetch, cast gender gate), `FavoriteTunerSmoke.test.js`.

## Asset / Image Performance (Jun 2026)

A pass over image + asset loading on the high-traffic home/library screen:

- **Lazy-load placeholder shrunk 316KB → 1.4KB.** The `v-lazy` `loading` placeholder behind every grid poster (`DBGridLayoutSearchResult.vue`) was `sheen.jpg` — a full 2000×3000 poster. Replaced with `sheen-placeholder.jpg` (40×60, metadata-stripped, visually identical when stretched). Old file deleted; it had a single reference.
- **`moment` removed** — it was a direct dependency with ZERO imports anywhere in `src/`. Dropped from `package.json`; confirmed gone from `yarn.lock` (nothing transitive needed it).
- **Library grid posters w500 → w342** (`DBGridLayoutSearchResult.vue:11`, the `v-lazy` src only). ~55% fewer bytes per poster at the rendered mobile size. Other w500 usages (details-modal backdrop on line 48, StickinessInline, TweakInline, ShareDBResults, PickMedia, RateMovie) intentionally kept — they show one/two large posters where w500 is right.
- **Lazy-load pre-trigger** (`main.js`): `VueLazyLoad` now passes `observerOptions: { rootMargin: '1200px 0px' }` (default was `'0px'`). Posters start fetching ~1.5 screens before entering the viewport, so the placeholder is effectively never seen on normal scroll. Dial: bump to `'2000px'` if fast scrolls still flash placeholders, drop to `'800px'` to be stingier on data.
- **`vue3-calendar-heatmap` removed (Jul 2026)** — registered globally in `main.js` (`app.use(VueCalendarHeatmap)`) but with **zero template usages anywhere** (`grep -ri heatmap src/**/*.vue` — nothing; the actual calendar UI is `FullCalendarView.vue`, built on `@fullcalendar/*`, a completely different library). Same dead-weight pattern as the `moment` removal above — it just hadn't been noticed because it doesn't throw or lint-warn (registered as a plugin, not an unused import). Its transitive dependency `tippy.js` (also listed, redundantly, as our own direct dependency despite zero direct imports) went with it. `chunk-vendors.js`: 796 KB → 762 KB (220 KB → 209 KB gzipped) — modest, but it's dead code either way.
- **Bundle-size investigation (Jul 2026)**: the obvious suspects — Chart.js, `vue-chart-3`, `@fullcalendar/*` — turned out to **already be correctly code-split** into their own per-route async chunks (`insights.js`, `year-in-review.js`, a numbered chunk), *not* sitting in the eager `chunk-vendors.js`. Verified by grepping the built `dist/js/*.js` files for library-specific strings (e.g. `"Chart.js v"`, `"FullCalendar"`) rather than assuming from import locations. What *is* in `chunk-vendors.js` is dominated by Firebase (the full app+auth+database modular SDK, ~62 string-match density vs. next-highest ~15-21 for Vuex/tippy/axios/Sentry) — all things `main.js`/`store/index.js` need eagerly on every page (auth state, routing guards read `store.getters` synchronously), so there's no easy "just lazy-load it" lever left without swapping Firebase for something lighter, which is a much bigger undertaking than tonight's scope. Net: the vendor bundle is already close to as lean as it can get without a larger architectural change; 762 KB / 209 KB gzipped for an app this size isn't alarming for a personal app used by a handful of people.

## "Can't scroll to the bottom" + sideways scroll on iOS PWA (Jun 2026)

Symptom (reported on the installed iOS PWA, phone only): the page scrolls *most* of the way but stops ~5% short of the bottom, hiding the bottom controls (Submit / poster buttons). On RateMovie it *intermittently* also wants to scroll **horizontally**, into empty space (nothing visible is out there). It builds up over a session across **all** screens and only resets on a force-quit/reload.

**Root cause — a form field overflowing its grid column horizontally, which latches the iOS layout viewport wider than the screen.** RateMovie's date field is `<input type="datetime-local">` in a narrow Bootstrap `.col-5` (the `medium` `<select>` in `.col-4` is a milder version). These controls have a UA-imposed **intrinsic minimum width** (datetime-local reserves room for "MM/DD/YYYY, --:-- --") that beats Bootstrap's `width: 100%`, so the field's layout box pokes past the right edge even though its visible area looks fine — hence "I can scroll over but there's nothing there." On the standalone iOS PWA that horizontal overflow latches the layout viewport wider than the visual viewport; the now-too-wide viewport throws off every screen's `100vh`-based vertical layout, cutting off the bottom, until the app is fully reloaded. The two symptoms (sideways scroll + cumulative bottom cut-off) are one bug.

Fix (two complementary parts):
- **Root cause — `RateMovie.vue` `.form-control, .form-select { min-width: 0; max-width: 100%; }`** (scoped under `.rate-movie`). `min-width: 0` lets the controls shrink to their column instead of overflowing it. This is the actual fix.
- **Global safety net — `App.vue` `.cinema-roll { overflow-x: hidden; max-width: 100%; }`.** Clips *any* stray horizontal overflow (current or future, from any component) so the page can never scroll sideways and the viewport can never latch. Vertical page scroll is unaffected (the document, not `.cinema-roll`, is the vertical scroll container). Without this the datetime field would just be clipped; without the min-width fix it would fit but be cut on the right — both are needed.

Verified earlier (browser, desktop width 2560): zero horizontal overflow on Home or RateMovie — confirming the offender is width-dependent (fine when the column is wide, overflows only at phone width). Test impact: RateMovie/Home suites still pass (CSS-only change). To re-verify on device, test the actual iOS PWA — the overflow does not reproduce at desktop width.

### Unrelated minor fix landed alongside: modal scroll-lock leak
While investigating, a *separate* latent bug was found and fixed (it is NOT the cause of the above — `body.no-scroll`'s `overflow:hidden` blocks ALL scrolling, not a 5% short-stop). Modals lock body scroll via the global `body.no-scroll` class (`App.vue`; toggled by `Modal.vue`, the 8 `Favorite*` components, Home's movie-info modal) or `document.body.style.overflow` (`RateMovie.vue`'s context modal), relying on their own close handler. `Home.rateMovieFromModal()` routed to `/rate-movie` without removing `no-scroll`, leaking the lock onto later screens. Fixes: `router.afterEach(() => { document.body.classList.remove('no-scroll'); document.body.style.overflow=''; })` in `src/router/index.js` (global safety net for the whole modal class) + `rateMovieFromModal()` now calls `closeMovieInfoModal()` before navigating. Tests: `src/test/ScrollLockCleanup.test.js`. (The router `afterEach` isn't unit-tested — importing the real router pulls in `store/index.js` which inits Firebase at module load.)

## RateMovie rating-select extraction (Jun 2026)

The eight rating criteria on RateMovie (direction, imagery, story, performance, soundtrack, stickiness, love, overall) used to be eight near-identical inline `<div>`+`<label>`+`<select>` blocks (~330 lines, with five byte-identical copies of the standard 0–10 option list). Extracted to a presentational child + a data-driven `v-for`:

- **`src/components/RatingSelect.vue`** — props `label`, `description`, `name`, `options` (`[{ value, label }]`), `modelValue`; emits `update:modelValue`. Renders the wrapper/label/description and a native `<select>` whose `v-model` is proxied through a `selected` computed, so binding semantics match the old inline markup **exactly** (string option values; a `null` initial shows the leading empty option, which the component renders — it's NOT in the `options` array). All scoring/default logic stays in the parent.
- **`RateMovie.vue`** — three module-level option constants (`STANDARD_OPTIONS`, `LOVE_OPTIONS`, `STICKINESS_OPTIONS`, built via `.map((label, value) => ({ value: String(value), label }))`) feed a `RATING_FIELDS` array (`{ key, label, description, options }`) exposed as `data().ratingFields`. The template is one `<RatingSelect v-for="field in ratingFields" v-model="$data[field.key]" :name="field.key" …/>`. **`v-model="$data[field.key]"` is deliberate** — it keeps the eight flat data props (`this.direction`, etc.), so `rating`, `addRating`, weights math, etc. are untouched (zero blast radius outside the template). `field.key` doubles as the data-prop name, the select id/name, and the criterion name used by the rating math, so array order = on-screen order.
- Per-scale shapes: STANDARD (0–10) is shared by direction/imagery/story/performance/overall; LOVE is 0–10 values with custom labels (-5…5); STICKINESS is 0–5. RateMovie's `<style>` is **not** scoped, so `.rate-movie .form-select { min-width:0; max-width:100% }` still applies to the child-rendered selects.

Tests (written before the extraction as the safety net): `src/test/RateMovieSelects.test.js` asserts at the **DOM level** (full `mount`, not shallowMount — which would stub the child) the 8 selects' labels, exact option value/label lists, and v-model binding; it was confirmed green on the OLD inline code first, then on the refactor, so it proves behavioral equivalence. `src/test/RatingSelect.test.js` unit-tests the child (render, empty option, modelValue reflection, emit).

## Insights: `estimatedMoviesThisYear` clarity pass (Jul 2026)

Bug report: "I don't really remember how I calculated that, can you look that over and see if it seems like it's giving an accurate number or if we could make it more precise." (The "N to Date"/year-end-pace estimate shown on the Insights page, `Insights.vue`'s `estimatedMoviesThisYear` computed.)

- **Audited the math by hand — no actual bug, but real obfuscation.** The pre-existing formula computed "movies per week this year" and "movies per month this year" by rescaling the SAME whole-year-so-far daily rate up and back down again (`moviesWatchedThisYear / (dayOfYear / 7)`, then `* (remainingDays / 7)`) — algebra shows those two terms are exactly identical to just `(moviesWatchedThisYear / dayOfYear) * remainingDays`, so despite reading like three independently-computed estimates blended together (`combinedEstimate`), it always reduced to using the whole-year rate three times over. The GENUINE diversification (recent-2-week rate, recent-2-month rate) was already present, one level further down in the formula (`recentWeeksAdjustment`/`recentMonthsAdjustment`) — and once the redundant middle step's algebra is followed through, the ORIGINAL code's final output already exactly equals a clean, honest equal-weighted blend of (whole-year rate, recent-2-week rate, recent-2-month rate) projected across the remaining days. Confirmed this is not just an approximation but a byte-for-byte identical result by simplifying the formula and running it against the existing characterization test in `Insights.test.js` (`estimatedMoviesThisYear` for a fixed fixture → same locked-in value, `15`, unchanged).
- **Fix: simplified to the clean 3-rate-blend form directly** (`wholeYearRate`, `recentWeeksRate`, `recentMonthsRate`, all normalized to movies/day, averaged, then `* remainingDays`) — same output, but now honestly reflects what it computes instead of laundering one number through three redundant unit conversions. No visible number changed for any user.
- **Not changed**: the actual WEIGHTING (equal thirds) or which time-windows feed the estimate. Favoring recent behavior more heavily than the whole-year average would be a legitimate, arguably-more-accurate alternative (recent pace usually predicts near-future pace better than a stale year-to-date average, especially early in the year when the whole-year rate is based on very little data) — but that's a genuine philosophy/design call about what "accurate" should mean here, not a bug fix, so it wasn't made unilaterally. Revisit if the user wants a different weighting.

### 4th signal: last year's seasonal shape, guarded (Jul 2026, immediate follow-up)
User's own framing: "can we look at what I was doing last year and use that to help guide the number... build in some guards against people with very small libraries, so it only works for those where it will actually be effective."

- **What it adds**: a genuinely NEW kind of signal, not another rescaling of the same rate. The existing 3 estimates all extrapolate THIS year's own recent pace forward — none of them can see real seasonality (e.g. habitually watching more during awards season, or less during a busy summer). New `seasonalProjectedAdditional` computed: takes the fraction of LAST year's full-year total that had already been watched by this exact same calendar date (via the pre-existing `moviesWatchedLastYear`/`moviesWatchedLastYearToDate` computeds — `moviesWatchedLastYearToDate` already correctly compares by month/day, not a raw day-of-year count, so it's leap-year-safe for free), then scales this year's current count by the inverse of that fraction to imply a full-year total, and returns the ADDITIONAL movies that implies. `estimatedMoviesThisYear` pushes this onto the same array of "additional movies" estimates the other 3 already populate and averages them all equally — becomes a 4-way blend whenever the signal qualifies, otherwise stays exactly the pre-existing 3-way blend (verified: the untouched characterization test for a fixture with no prior-year data still returns the same locked-in `15`).
- **Three independent guards, each able to disqualify the signal on its own** (`seasonalProjectedAdditional` returns `null`, which `estimatedMoviesThisYear` treats as "leave this signal out," not zero):
  - `MIN_LAST_YEAR_TOTAL = 12` — a full prior year averaging under one movie a month isn't enough texture to imply a real "shape." This ALSO naturally excludes anyone who wasn't using the app (or didn't exist as a user) last year, since their full-year total would be 0 — no separate "does last year's data even exist" check needed, it falls out of the same threshold.
  - `MIN_LAST_YEAR_TO_DATE = 4` — a fraction computed from only a couple of movies is noisy regardless of how large the denominator is (1 movie by this date out of a 20-movie year is a real data point, but far too thin to trust as "typical").
  - `MIN_FRACTION = 0.15` — a belt-and-suspenders floor on the FRACTION itself, independent of the two count guards above: caps how aggressively the signal can scale up the estimate even when both counts clear their thresholds but the split still happens to be extremely lopsided (e.g. a binge-heavy December last year) — `Math.max(fraction, MIN_FRACTION)` before dividing, so one unusual year can nudge the blend without dominating it.
- Tests: `Insights.test.js` — each guard tested in isolation (a fixture that only trips ONE threshold at a time, confirming they're independently sufficient to disqualify), an exactly hand-computable non-guard-tripping case (0.5 fraction, round numbers, asserts the precise implied value rather than just "not null"), the `MIN_FRACTION` floor case (asserts the capped value, not the uncapped one), and a differential test proving the signal actually reaches `estimatedMoviesThisYear`'s final blended output (identical "this year" data, with vs. without a qualifying prior year, asserting the two final estimates differ) rather than just checking `seasonalProjectedAdditional` in isolation.

## Box Office / Budget on MovieDetail (Jul 2026)

`MovieDetail.vue` now shows a "Box Office" section (Budget + Box Office/revenue, formatted as USD via `Intl.NumberFormat`) when either figure is known.

- **No new network call**: TMDB's `/movie/{id}` response (already fetched by `getTMDBData` for every rating/re-rate) already includes `budget`/`revenue` — `AddRating.js`'s `shapeTmdbDataIntoMovie` just wasn't extracting them into the stored movie object. Now does, alongside everything else it already pulls from that same response.
- **Graceful degradation for existing library entries**: only movies rated/re-rated after this change have `budget`/`revenue` stored locally (`MovieDetail.vue`'s `loadMovieData` is a pure local lookup, no live TMDB fetch — deliberately kept that way, consistent with this app's documented move away from per-view live TMDB calls, e.g. the Academy Awards migration). An older entry simply doesn't render the section at all, same convention every other optional section here already follows (Cast/Keywords/Production Companies/etc. are all `v-if`-guarded). `movieBudget`/`movieRevenue` computeds treat both `undefined` (never stored) and `0` (TMDB's own "not available" convention — it doesn't distinguish that from a genuinely free production) identically as "unknown."
- **Free side effect**: `Insights.vue`'s "taste profile" scoring (`calculateBlockbusterScale` and several sibling genre-personality heuristics) already read `movie.budget || 0` defensively — since `budget` was never actually stored before now, that factor was silently always contributing 0. It'll start reflecting real data for any movie rated after this change, no code change needed there.
- Placed right after Genres, before Awards — a "core facts about the film" section, grouped with Genre rather than the People/Company sections (Cast/Crew/Production Companies) that follow.

Tests: `TMDbDataProcessing.test.js`'s existing "should correctly transform TMDb data for storage" test extended with budget/revenue assertions. `MovieDetail.test.js` new "Box Office" describe block: both figures present, budget-only, revenue-only, both zero, and the field-entirely-absent (pre-existing library entry) case.

### Backfill button for the existing library (same day, immediate follow-up)
Direct feedback: "I needed to appear on all my movies... it should always work even on all the movies I've already rated." Graceful degradation was the right call for the initial ship (no live TMDB fetch on every MovieDetail view), but leaving hundreds of already-rated movies permanently without this data wasn't - a one-time catch-up was needed, not just "wait until you happen to re-rate it."

- **New pure module, `src/assets/javascript/backfillBoxOffice.js`** — same `warmImageCache`-style shape (`offlinePosterCache.js`) already established for the "Download all posters for offline" Settings button: worker-pool `concurrency` (default 4, a bit more conservative than image downloads since these are real TMDB API calls, not CDN image fetches), `onProgress({completed, total, failed})`, an `AbortSignal`, store-free/unit-testable without mounting anything.
  - `collectMoviesNeedingBoxOffice(movieLog)` — candidates are entries with a real (non-placeholder) `movie.id` and both `budget`/`revenue` falsy. **Known, accepted tradeoff**: TMDB's own `0` = "no data" convention means a movie TMDB genuinely has no financials for is indistinguishable from "never fetched," so it stays a candidate on every future run too - a deliberate simplicity choice over adding a separate "already checked" marker field, since this only costs a handful of wasted re-fetches for genuinely-data-less movies, not a functional bug.
  - `fetchBoxOffice(tmdbId)` — a single `/movie/{id}` call (no credits/keywords - this backfill doesn't need them).
  - `backfillBoxOffice(movieLog, writeFn, options)` — the orchestrator; persistence is injected via `writeFn(dbKey, boxOffice, entry)` rather than importing the store directly, keeping the module pure. **Idempotent and safe to re-run by construction**: candidates are computed fresh from current `movieLog` state, so a partial run (or one from days ago, after a batch of new ratings) just picks up wherever it left off — no separate resume/checkpoint logic needed.
- **`Home.vue` wiring** (`backfillBoxOfficeData()`, new `boxOfficeBackfill` state, mirrors `offlineDownload`'s exact shape/UI pattern) — the injected `writeFn`: reads the CURRENT `state.movieLog[dbKey]` fresh (not a captured closure) and commits an updated copy via the existing `setMovieLogEntry` mutation so the grid/detail page reflect it immediately without a reload, then durably persists via **two separate leaf-path writes** (`movieLog/<key>/movie/budget`, `movieLog/<key>/movie/revenue`) rather than one write to the whole `movie` object — a `set()` at the `movie` path would replace it wholesale, risking clobbering cast/crew/genres/etc. with a possibly-stale local snapshot. Uses `writeDatabaseEntryNow` (the direct, no-queue write action from the offline-rating work above) **without** the durable-queue-first treatment ratings get — this is re-fetchable TMDB metadata, not irreplaceable user data, and a failed write just leaves that movie as a candidate for the next run, which is an acceptable, self-healing failure mode here (unlike a lost rating).
- New Settings-panel button, "Fill in box office data for all movies," directly under the existing "Download all posters for offline" one, same progress-spinner/success-summary convention.

Tests: `src/test/backfillBoxOffice.test.js` (pure module - candidate selection incl. the 0/0-stays-a-candidate tradeoff and placeholder exclusion, fetch normalization, progress reporting, per-item fetch/write failure isolation, abort-signal support, concurrency capping). Caught a real off-by-a-typo bug while writing these: the initial candidate filter used `!movie.id` to exclude entries with no id, which also excludes `id: 0` - never happens with real TMDB ids (always ≥ 1) but was worth tightening to `movie.id == null` anyway once a test fixture happened to use `0` and exposed it. No dedicated Home.vue-mount test for the button wiring itself, matching the established precedent that `downloadForOffline`/`offlineDownload` (the analogous, older feature) also has no such test - only its pure module is directly tested.

## Phantom scroll on every page (Aug 2026)

Bug report: *"the content does not go below the bottom edge of the screen, but the page still can scroll down quite a bit. It seems like maybe we're forcing a height in here maybe that's because we wanted to get that footer bar to stay stuck to the bottom."* The diagnosis was exactly right.

**13 components each declared `min-height: 100vh`** on their own root — every game, plus MovieDetail, TrophyCase and YearInReview. `.cinema-roll` is a flex column that already has `min-height: 100vh`, so the page came out as `header + a FULL viewport + footer`, i.e. roughly a header's worth of empty space to scroll through on **every one of those pages**, always.

The rule meant to handle this, `.cinema-roll > router-view`, **never matched anything**: `<router-view>` renders the matched component *in its place*, so no `router-view` element exists in the DOM. It had been dead the whole time, which is why each page had grown its own `min-height` workaround.

Fixed by wrapping `<router-view>` in `<main class="app-main">` (`display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; flex-direction: column`) with `.app-main > * { flex: 1 1 auto }`, and deleting `min-height: 100vh` from all 13 components. The page now stretches to fill whatever is left below the header — same "footer at the bottom" result, no phantom scroll:
- short content → total is exactly `100vh`, nothing to scroll
- long content → total is the natural height, scrolls only as far as it needs

Checked before shipping: the three surviving `height: 100%` rules in those components are all on images inside fixed-size parents (a timeline gap, the backdrop container, a poster box), so none relied on the page being a viewport tall; and every routed component is single-root, so `.app-main > *` can't split space between siblings.

## Deep Stats reworked, and the Standouts pantheon (Aug 2026)

Matt's review of the page: *"the first three cards are all repeats of things that are
already on the overview page… I like the idea of the crown, but it's taking up too much
vertical space… The Pantheon is interesting, but I have too many movies in each of these
categories for it to be really fascinating… I do like the idea of constellations… The
Marathon Club, I don't really know what these things mean… there's having eight top days
is too much… for each of the years, what is it actually telling me?… by genre, I like
that we have these genres, but I don't think I need the top twelve of them… we should
maybe just have each genre listed with a few examples and then a log score."*

The cuts, all of them vertical-space-driven: the top strip (titles / viewings / screen
time) deleted outright as an Overview repeat; the Crown turned from a vertical timeline
into a sideways poster row; the Pantheon's per-category lists dropped, keeping only
Constellations; Marathon Club's top days cut 8 → 3 and its caption rewritten to actually
say what it measures ("Not consecutive days; the biggest ones"); Years compressed into a
poster row; Genres cut to 8 with 5 examples each. The page went from ~9,100px to ~6,700px.

### Standouts: why ranking by Log Score was wrong

The new idea was Matt's: *"it'd be cool to find outliers around, like, things that have
unusually high log scores. Not just genres, but keywords and directors and all that
stuff… that would be an interesting pantheon to find."*

`standouts()` buckets the library by every facet at once — genre, keyword, studio,
director, composer, cinematographer, top-5 cast, decade — and ranks them against each
other. The first implementation ranked by Log Score, which read as the obvious choice and
was wrong. Against the real 1,374-film library it returned:

    Drama · Comedy · 1990s · hilarious · 2010s · Crime · based on novel or book · Pixar

That is a list of the biggest categories, i.e. a restatement of the library's shape. The
mechanism is Log Score's **rank weighting**: `rankWeight / (rankWeight + i)` means a
group is scored mostly by its best few films, and your biggest genre is also where all
your favourites live. So a huge, thoroughly average genre scores high for a reason that
has nothing to do with being a standout.

Ranking is now by **lift**: a Bayesian-adjusted mean minus the global average, using the
same prior Log Score uses (`bayesianWeight`, default 7). Shrinkage does the work Log
Score's rank weighting was mistakenly being asked to do — eight films at 9.5 survives it,
one film at 10 does not — without also rewarding size. Log Score still displays alongside,
because "how good is this corner outright" is a fair second question. The same library
then returns:

    Pixar · hilarious · Michael Giacchino · Joel Coen · Roger Deakins · Eddie Murphy

### The keyword flood

Ranked purely by lift, **16 of 24 slots came back as TMDB keywords** and no director,
actor or studio appeared at all — TMDB tags films with far more keywords than anything
else, so keywords simply have more chances to win. A `perType` cap (3 per facet type,
12 overall) restores the variety that was the whole point of ranging across facets.

Both failures are covered by tests that were checked against the broken code first
(`src/test/standouts.test.js`) — the log-score fixture is specifically shaped so the big
category wins on Log Score (7.99) and loses on lift (-0.06), because an earlier version of
that test passed under both rankings and guarded nothing.
