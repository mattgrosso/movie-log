// The in-memory limiter above cannot do that job. It is per-container, so a
// burst spread across concurrent Lambdas slips through it, and a cold start
// wipes it. Fine as a speed bump for the automatic routes; useless as a
// ceiling.
//
// This one is a real ceiling: an atomic counter in DynamoDB, incremented and
// checked in a single conditional write, so concurrency cannot beat it. It
// applies ONLY to /watchlist - the one route a human types into. The other
// three fire automatically while you browse (the file header notes ~5k calls a
// day), and a per-person daily cap on those would break ordinary use.
//

//   - PER USER, per day. Stops one person looping the endpoint.
//   - EVERYONE, per day. Stops a crowd, or a stolen token, from running up a
//     bill no single account would have reached.
//
// The numbers are chosen so nobody notices. A real session might use this five

Rules:
- Do not mention the movie's title, or any alternate/working title, in any fact.
- Prefer genuinely interesting behind-the-scenes, production, casting, reception, or legacy trivia over generic plot description.
- Each fact should be 1-2 sentences, self-contained, and true - do not invent or guess at trivia you are not confident is accurate.
- It's fine for later, easier facts to name the director or lead actors if that's genuinely how the trivia goes, but earlier facts should avoid it when possible.
