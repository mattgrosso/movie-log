// Bug report 2026-08-26: "When I click the toggle for adjusted for inflation,
// it shouldn't close that sort drop down because then I just have to reopen it
// and pick another thing."
//
// The cause, found by reproducing it against real Bootstrap 5.3.3 rather than
// by reading the source: **Bootstrap registers its delegated data-api handlers
// with useCapture TRUE** (EventHandler passes the `delegation` flag straight
// into addEventListener's third argument). So the document-level
// [data-bs-toggle] click handler runs BEFORE anything inside the menu can see
// the event. While the <ul> was nested inside the toggle <button>, every click
// in the menu therefore reached the toggle and shut it, and NO amount of
// @click.stop could prevent it — two attempts failed exactly that way.
//
// The fix is to take the toggle out of the event path: the <ul> is now a
// SIBLING of the button inside the existing .btn-group, which is Bootstrap's
// own documented structure. Picking a sort closes the menu again on its own
// (clearMenus), and the money toggle's @click.stop now works because the
// event only has to be stopped before it reaches document in the BUBBLE
// phase, which is where clearMenus lives.
//
// The other way to fix it — wrapping the toggle in <div class="dropdown"> —
// is a trap, guarded below.
//
// Asserted against the source: jsdom loads no Bootstrap JS, so a mounted
// component has no dropdown to open and a test that tried would pass against
// the broken page.

  const text = source();

};

  // THE TRAP. These chips take their colours from
  // .results-actions-button:nth-child(N), and `flex: 1 1 0` sits on the
  // button rather than on any wrapper — so wrapping the toggle recolours and
  // resizes the row. The <ul> is only safe as a sibling because the sort chip
  // is the LAST button in the group; putting it anywhere earlier would shift
  // every chip after it.

// Follow-on report, 2026-08-26: "the drop down menu that comes out of the sort
// goes full width, and it's way too big. Before it was nice and compact over
// on the right hand side."
//
// Moving the menu out of the toggle button exposed a rule that had been
// catching it all along: `.home .results ul { width: 100% }`, meant for the
// results list. It was invisible while the menu lived inside the 157px chip —
// 100% of a chip looks exactly like a compact dropdown — and became 800px the
// moment the menu's parent became the full-width .btn-group. Measured live.
