// "Send to hat" for one movie or a whole list — Matt, 2026-08-16: "fill a
// hat from a list is kind of the same as send to a hat. It just iterates
// through the list."
//
// Cinema Roll originally did NOT track what's in a hat — "we don't really
// need to keep track of that... if you try to add something to a hat, it
// should just notify you back that it's already in there" (2026-08-16).
// That changed on 2026-08-17: "it would be nice if the hat icon button only
// appeared on movies that aren't already in one of my hats", which can only
// be known before the tap. So the store now keeps a cached set of the ids
// waiting in linked hats (ensureMovieHatContents) and this button hides
// itself for them. The send-time check stays exactly as it was — it is
// still the authority, and still reports "already in there" if the cache
// was stale or a hat could not be read.

 * it's not a circle maybe it's like a diagonal ribbon that takes up that top
 * right corner and has a little hat in it."
 *
 * A 26px disc inset 4px from the corner had its centre ~17px into the poster,
 * which on a small one is most of the way to the middle. A right triangle
 * hugging the corner keeps the same 44px tap area while its mass sits in the

 * AWAY from the centre — so the deeper into the poster you go, the less of it
 * the control covers. Titles, which sit centred or low, stay clear.
