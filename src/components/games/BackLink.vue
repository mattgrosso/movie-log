  <!-- The edge-swipe gesture ("I should be able to swipe left from the left
       edge of the screen") is bound on the WINDOW, not on an element. It used
       to be a fixed, full-height, 20px-wide invisible strip at z-index 500 —
       which sat on top of anything within 20px of the left edge and silently
       ate taps on it, since the strip only responds to a swipe. With most game
       screens using 16px padding, that covered a few pixels of every
       left-hand button: "I tap them. Nothing happens. I have to tap them
       again." Filtering by where the touch STARTED gives the same gesture
       while covering nothing. -->
