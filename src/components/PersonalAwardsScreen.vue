// The Personal Awards flow as a real page (feedback: the modal "always
// feels a little bit janky... maybe it would feel better if it was just a
// full page like we do for other things"). This also fixes the
// intermittent open-failure for good: Insights/MovieDetail used to write
// three settings flags via setDBValue — which never commits locally — then
// navigate Home and hope the Firebase echo arrived before the modal gate
// looked. Now the year rides in the URL (/awards?year=1997) and there is
// no handoff to race.
//
// The old AwardsResults browser used to sit below this — a year <select>
// plus a winners table, relocated here from Insights. It's gone: the page
// above it now IS the view of a year's awards, and the year strip replaces
// its dropdown ("I don't think we need that anymore. I think we've replaced
// it with what we're looking at now", 2026-08-16).
