// One presentation for every list on the watchlist (Matt, 2026-08-16):
//
//   "All over this page you've ignored my rule that posters are better than
//    text. You've got a bunch of movie posters with the titles written out
//    right below them."
//
//   "I like the idea of the 'get X year to 10' sections but they are too
//    large. They should be sideways scrolling lists."
//
//   "Every poster on a watchlist should have a button to easily add it to a
//    hat. But don't make the buttons ugly."
//
//   "The 'add all' buttons should be less prominent (maybe at the bottom of
//    the list)."
//
// So: one sideways-scrolling row of posters, no titles under them, a small
// hat button on each poster, and the bulk action demoted to below the row.
// Note this is NOT MediaResultGrid — that one is still right where it is
// used, choosing between similar search results, where the title is the
// only thing telling two candidates apart.
