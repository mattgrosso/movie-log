// Places: what the library's Wikidata locations (movieLocations.js) add up
// to. Pure and store-free, tested directly.
//
// Matt, 2026-09-08, on what he wanted from a second attempt: "I just think
// it would be fun to be able to see what movies are set where. Seeing that I
// really like movies set in Paris would be cool." So this file answers two
// questions — how often does each place come up, and how do the films set
// or shot there RATE — and leaves the drawing to CoverageMap.vue.
//
// A location is `{ name, lat, lon, type, id }` with type 'filming' (P915,
// where it was shot) or 'narrative' (P840, where the story is set). The two
// are kept apart all the way to the screen: "set in Paris" and "filmed in
// Paris" are different facts, and the report asked for both.

// How hard a place's average is pulled toward the library average before it
// is ranked. Two films at 9.5 should not outrank twelve at 9.0 — this is
// the same shrinkage idea the Favorite sections and Deep Stats use, sized
// small because a place with three films is already a real pattern.
