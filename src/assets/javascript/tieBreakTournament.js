// its state is plain JSON — it gets persisted directly to
// settings/tieBreakTournament in Firebase, since a tournament can span many
// days at the existing one-match-per-daily-quota-slot pace.
//
// Contestant membership is frozen at creation time (contestantIds is never
// recomputed from a fresh tie scan). That's deliberate: a movie rated later
// that happens to also match the tied score must NOT be swept into an
// already-running tournament — it waits for the next tie scan, which only
// ever runs once there is no active tournament (see TweakInline.vue).

// Finds the full contiguous run of entries sharing the same score as the
// first adjacent tie in `sortedEntries` (works regardless of best-first or
// worst-first order, since a tied group is contiguous either way).
// `getScore` extracts the comparable score from an entry.

 * Reorders a schedule so consecutive matches share no contestant, wherever

 *
 * Matt, 2026-08-19, on posters being slow to swap between rounds: "I think we
 * could solve a lot by just not letting the same movie be in two consecutive
 * matchups, then it wouldn't be as confusing."
 *
 * Right: when a film carries over, the screen changes only on one side, and a
 * half-loaded swap is indistinguishable from no swap at all. Two entirely
 * different posters can't be misread that way.
 *
 * Greedy, and it cannot always succeed — for the smallest ties the maths
 * forbids it:
 *
 *   3 films → 3 matches (ab, ac, bc). Every pair shares a film with every
 *     other pair, so both transitions repeat no matter the order.
 *   4 films → 6 matches. Each match has exactly ONE other it is disjoint
 *     from (its complement), so at most 3 of the 5 transitions can be clean
 *     and 2 repeats are forced.
 *   5+ films → 0 repeats, always achievable and achieved.
 *
 * Both small cases here hit the proven optimum, verified by brute force
 * against every permutation. They are also the common tie sizes, which is
 * why the loading gate in TweakInline is the other half of this fix rather
 * than a belt-and-braces extra: with three or four films tied, some
 * carry-over is unavoidable.
 *
 * Among the disjoint candidates it takes the one whose films have the most
 * matches still to play, which is what lifts 5+ from "nearly always clean"
 * to "always clean": it spends the constrained films while options remain,
 * instead of leaving them stranded together at the end. Ties keep the
 * earliest candidate, so a shuffled schedule keeps its shuffled character.
