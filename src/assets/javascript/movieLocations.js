// Geographic data for movies, sourced from Wikidata.
//
// Second attempt (2026-09-08). The first (Aug 2026) was built around drawing
// maps and was taken out; this file survived it verbatim because the DATA was
// the part that worked — see docs/history/geography-removed.md. Place
// counting, ranking and the country roll-up live in places.js; this file is
// only the fetch and the backfill.
//
// Wikidata is CC0, so unlike most film datasets there are no reuse
// restrictions at all. It joins directly to what we already store: property
// P4947 is the TMDB movie ID, so no fuzzy title matching is needed (measured
// at 99% match against the real library).
//
//   P915 - filming location   (where it was shot)
//   P840 - narrative location (where the story is set)
//   P625 - coordinate location, read off the location item itself
//
// Both are worth having and they answer different questions, so they're kept
// distinct all the way through to the UI rather than merged.
//
// Pure and store-free, in the same spirit as backfillBoxOffice.js /
// searchFiltering.js - persistence is injected so this can be unit tested
// without mounting anything or touching Vuex.
