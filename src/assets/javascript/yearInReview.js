// Deliberately NOT the same job as deepStats.js. That page interrogates the

// true of a single year, and the interesting questions are different — the
// rhythm of it, what was unusual about it, how it compared to the year before.
//
// The unit here is a VIEWING, not a film. A film watched twice in a year is
// two viewings and belongs to both months it was seen in. The old page mixed
// the two units — it counted films for the headline and viewings for the
// monthly chart, so the bars could add up to more than the total above them.
