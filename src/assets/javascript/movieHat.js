// Talking to Movie Hat from Cinema Roll.
//
// Movie Hat is a separate app with its own Firebase project, and it stays
// that way — Matt, 2026-08-16: "I love that it's a standalone app that I can
// let anybody who wants to use use... I don't wanna just bring it straight
// into cinema roll." What he does want is for the two to meet: send a movie
// (or a whole watchlist section) to a hat, and draw from a hat without
// leaving Cinema Roll.
//
// EVERY read and write to Movie Hat goes through this file. That is the
// point: the hats database is currently world-readable and world-writable
// over plain REST, and locking it down is coming. When it does, only this
// module changes.
//
// Movie Hat's own shape, which this deliberately conforms to rather than
// improves on:
//
//   hats/<hat title>/<dbKey>/
//     movies/<key>   → a raw TMDB movie + timeStamp, addedBy, note
//     history/<key>  → the same movie + dateDrawn
//     members/<key>  → an email address
//
// A draw is: pick uniformly at random, copy to history, delete from movies.
// It is destructive on purpose — that is what makes it a hat and not a
// shuffle button — so anything here that draws must do all three.

/**
 * A hat request refused for an auth reason, with the reason kept.
 *
 * Movie Hat's rules went on 2026-08-17 and every refusal since has surfaced
 * as the same unexplained "Movie Hat responded 401" — which is how the hats
 * section spent days dead without anyone being able to say whether the
 * session had lapsed, the wrong Google account was connected, or the database
 * was simply saying no. Three very different fixes; one indistinguishable
 * message. `reason` is what tells them apart:
 *
 *   'not-connected' — no Movie Hat session on this device.
 *   'token-failed'  — signed in, but no usable token (revoked, or offline).
 *   'denied'        — a good token, and the database still said no. Almost
 *                     always the wrong account: hat access is per member, so
 *                     being signed in as someone who isn't in this hat
 *                     (the automated tester, or a second Google account)
 *                     reads exactly like being signed out.
 *
 * `email` is whoever IS connected, so the UI can name them rather than making
 * the user go and look.
