// "Am I looking at new code?" — answered without opening devtools.
//
// House standard (Matt, 2026-08-22): every app shows its version and when that
// build was made, in one muted line, in the same format everywhere:
//
//     v1.96.4 · built Aug 22, 1:32 AM
//
// The timestamp is stamped at BUILD time, not page-load time — that's the
// distinction that makes it useful. A tab left open for a week keeps showing
// the build it is still running, so a stale one is obvious at a glance. Here
// the build time arrives as `VUE_APP_BUILD_TIME`, set in `vue.config.js` when
// the build starts (see the comment there), and the version is the existing
// `VUE_APP_VERSION` that `yarn deploy` bumps — no second version number.
