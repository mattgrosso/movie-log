// action. Deliberately separate from the Workbox runtime-caching config
// (vue.config.js): that config only caches an image the FIRST time it's
// actually requested (as you scroll/view it) — it does nothing proactively.
// This module is what makes "cache my WHOLE library" possible: it builds the
// full list of poster/backdrop URLs from movieLog and fetches each one so the
// already-registered CacheFirst route (see vue.config.js's 'tmdb-images'
// runtimeCaching entry) has a reason to store it.
const POSTER_SIZE = 'w342'; // matches the grid poster size (see CLAUDE.md's asset-perf notes)
const BACKDROP_SIZE = 'w500'; // matches MovieDetail's backdrop usage

// Exported so call sites that only have a single new poster/backdrop path
// (a fresh rating, a custom poster/backdrop pick) can build the exact same
// URL this module would've built during a full-library warm, and pass it to
// warmImageCache themselves — one source of truth for the size convention.
