// CADENCE (Matt, 2026-08-28: "It'll be nice if it just happened more
// regularly, you know, as the prompts come in"):
//   'asTheyCome' — the default. The Lambda sweeps every 15 minutes and pings
//     when something NEW is waiting, inside the waking window, spaced by
//     `pushesPerDay`. It deliberately does NOT re-announce a backlog it has
//     already mentioned — see aws-lambda/pushCadence.js, which owns every
//     one of those rules and is where the tests live.
//   'daily' — the original behaviour, one nudge at `hour`.
//
// `tz` places all of it in local time, so a trip abroad doesn't shift the
// nudges to 3am — as long as the app is opened there once to re-save it.
