//
// TMDB gives a real `popularity` score for PEOPLE (every cast/crew member
// on a movie's own /credits response) and, indirectly, for KEYWORDS and
// COMPANIES via how many movies share that keyword/company id
// (/discover/movie's total_results — TMDB doesn't expose a popularity
// field for either directly). The component fetches these live, once per
// round (ClueBudgetGame.vue); this module just turns a raw number into a
// price once it has one. All three curves are log-scaled on purpose —
// both popularity and movie-count have a long tail (a handful of huge
// values, everything else clustered low), so a linear scale would make
// almost every real value look identically cheap or identically expensive.

// band and gentler slope — a company's movie COUNT is a prolificness
// proxy, not a fame score (a24 vs. Warner Bros. isn't really "less
// famous," just less prolific), so it's a noisier signal than the other
// two and priced with a bit less confidence baked in.

// fingerprint is expensive. See CLAUDE.md for the full history, including
// why CAST_COSTS specifically prices #1 (top-billed) highest, not lowest.

// Builds every clue AVAILABLE for this movie (not yet purchased — the
// component tracks purchase state separately). Only includes a clue when
// the underlying data actually exists for this movie (e.g. no production
// company on file → no Production Company clue) — never a clue with
// nothing to show.
//
// `extras` carries everything that isn't persisted locally and has to be
// fetched live from TMDB per round (see ClueBudgetGame.vue):
//   - tagline: string. Omit/falsy → no Tagline clue offered at all yet.
//   - peoplePopularity: { [personName]: popularity } from the movie's own
//     /credits response. A name missing from this map just uses the
//     fallback cost for that clue — never blocks the clue from appearing.
//   - keywordMovieCounts: { [keywordString]: total_results } — only ever
//     populated for keywords that came from TMDB (have a resolvable
//     keyword id; AI/custom keywords don't and always use the fallback).
//   - companyMovieCount: total_results for the primary production company.
//   - yourRating: the player's own calculated score for this movie (number).
//     Not derivable here — see the Your Rating clue below.
// Call buildClueDeck again as each extra resolves to refresh prices in
// place — the component re-merges rather than replacing already-purchased
// clues, so a price update never retroactively changes what was paid.
