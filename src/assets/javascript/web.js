// The Web: the library as one connected picture.
//
// Matt, 2026-09-08: "Maybe a movie has a web and you could see visually how
// that movie is connected to other movies and really to all movies... one
// giant web of connections between like this person was in this and also
// was in this and that person has their own branching web... a visualization
// that lets me zoom in and pan around to look at the web of my whole
// database."
//
// This module is the data half of that, pure and store-free: it turns rated
// entries into nodes (films and the people who join them) and links (one
// credit each), cuts the neighbourhood around any one node, and colours a
// film by its score. WebScreen.vue lays it out and draws it.
//
// The graph is BIPARTITE, film <-> person, never film <-> film: a film with
// three regulars shares three visible threads with the next film, and a
// person is a node you can tap, walk to, and see the web of. A person who
// appears in only ONE film is not a node at all — they join nothing to
// anything, and there are 40,000 of them. Cast is capped per film at
// CAST_LIMIT the way Six Degrees caps it, so a bit-part in position 38
// doesn't turn every film into a neighbour of every other; directors are
// always in, never capped (same reasoning as sixDegrees.js).
