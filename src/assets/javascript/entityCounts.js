// files (a bug report questioning the badges' accuracy surfaced two real
// bugs in that duplicated logic; see CLAUDE.md).

// Every function takes the already-flatKeywords-added entries array plus
// whether short films should be counted, so callers control both inputs

// full list); crew is filtered by JOB instead of array position, matching

// background department credit TMDB lists (grips, sound mixers, etc.) that
