// Splitting one person's films into Director / Cast / Producer / … sections.
//
// Matt, 2026-08-23: "I'm afraid that we've lost our sections in the search
// results. I've searched for Stephen Spielberg and his direction, acting, and
// production are all smooshed."
//
// He's right, and it was deliberate — d4580ec (2026-08-18) turned grouping off
// for EVERY typed chip to fix Natalie's tag:DARK report, and said so in its own
// message: "a chip built by tapping a person in the typeahead now lists that
// person's films flat, rather than split into Director / Cast / Producer."
// That was the correct call for tags and genres and the wrong one for people,
// because a person is the case where the sections ARE the answer.
//
// The reason it had to be turned off wholesale is worth stating, because this
// module exists to make it not apply: the free-text grouped view RE-SEARCHES
// the chip's bare value across Title, Director, Cast, Producer, Companies and
// Keywords. Re-searching is what leaked — a tag chip for "DARK" showed every
// film with "dark" in its TITLE, including ones the chip itself excluded.
//
// So this does not re-search anything. It PARTITIONS the flat filtered results
// the chip already produced: every film in, exactly one section, nothing from
// outside. A film that can't appear in the flat list can't appear here, which
// is a structural guarantee rather than a promise.

// the same labels the free-text grouped view already shows, so a person chip
// and a typed name produce sections that read identically.
