// that supply those from component state, so all existing call sites are unchanged.

// the equivalence is guarded by SortResultsFast.test.js, ChipFiltering.test.js,
// QuickLinksFiltering.test.js (via the wrappers) plus searchFiltering.test.js
// (direct unit tests of these exports).

// The text primitives live in searchText.js (Phase 3: the kind registry
// needs them without an import cycle); re-exported here so the many existing
// importers keep working unchanged.
