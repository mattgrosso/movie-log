// the input a person like a director or an actor and get the full list their
// entire filmography that would be really great cause then I could go through
// and add them all to hat easily."
//
// This is deliberately NOT the discover.js treatment. Every other list on the
// watchlist screen is a RECOMMENDATION: rankWatchlistCandidates drops anything
// already rated, filters cast credits to `order < 10`, keeps directors only,
// and sorts by a quality score. That is the wrong shape here — "their entire
// filmography" means the whole list, in the order a filmography reads (newest
// first), including the ones already seen. The films already in the library
// are marked rather than removed, because knowing you've seen nine of the
// twelve is the useful part when you're deciding what to hat.

// Crew jobs that count as authorship. A person's full crew credit list also
// carries producer, executive producer, thanks, and second-unit work, which
// for anyone established runs to hundreds of entries and buries the films
// they're actually known for. These four are what "a film by" means.
