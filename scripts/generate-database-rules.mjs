// Generates database.rules.json.
//
// Cinema Roll stores each user's library under a top-level key derived from
// their email address (see src/assets/javascript/databaseKey.js). The security
// rules have to perform that exact same transformation on `auth.token.email` to
// decide who may read a branch — and if the two ever disagree, users lose
// access to their own data.
//
// The rules language has no regex, only `String.replace(substring, replacement)`
// (which replaces every occurrence), so the transformation has to be written as
// a chain of calls. Generating that chain from the same character list the app
// uses is the only way to keep them provably in step.
//
// Usage:  node scripts/generate-database-rules.mjs
// Then:   npx firebase deploy --only database
//
// READ THE DEPLOY ORDER NOTE IN CLAUDE.md BEFORE DEPLOYING THESE RULES.
